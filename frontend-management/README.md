## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (for version control)

## Clone the Repository

Use Git to clone the project repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Chiaraliz/CITS5206_Project.git
```

## Install Dependencies

Install the required project dependencies using `npm`:

```
npm install
```

## Run the Development Server

To start the project in development mode, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will run the `Vite` development server, and the app will be available on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Using TailwindCSS

If you're making modifications to the styles, TailwindCSS is already configured in the project. You can edit styles directly in your components using Tailwind's utility classes. If you need to customize Tailwind, you can edit the `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of the project.
